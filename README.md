<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


In recent years, there were lots of improvements in Minecraft. The most typical update was version 1.13 to version 1.15, which are the most promising versions in terms of performance. Those improvements have caused some of the most popular Minecraft servers to run outdated versions. Witnessing that problem, we started the Wyvern project. 

We focus on enhancing vanilla Minecraft without sacrificing any behavior or features. You can think of this project as vanilla Minecraft, but with even more optimization and higher performance.
